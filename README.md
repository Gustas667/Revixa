# Revixa
Revixa is a single-page web app that analyzes customer reviews from a URL or pasted text. It finds top praises and complaints, then generates SEO titles, meta descriptions, product bullet points, and ad angles. Built for Vercel with a serverless /api/fetch to bypass CORS, it works instantly after deployment and requires no server setup.
